> A WebAssembly runtime is a software environment that executes programs compiled to the WebAssembly (Wasm) binary format, enabling efficient and portable execution of code on the web. Notable runtimes include V8, SpiderMonkey, and Wasmtime.

- **[aWsm](https://github.com/gwsystems/aWsm):** CLI \
    WebAssembly ahead-of-time compiler and runtime. Focuses on generating fast code, simplicity, and portability.

- **[Extism](https://extism.org/):** CLI, Rust, JavaScript, Elixr, Go, Haskell, Java, .NET, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Zig, C, C++ \
    The framework for building with WebAssembly (wasm). Easily load wasm modules, move data, call functions, and build extensible apps.

- **[Fizzy](https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy):** CLI, C, Rust \
    Fizzy aims to be a fast, deterministic, and pedantic WebAssembly interpreter written in C++.

- **[GraalWasm](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/wasm):** Java \
    GraalWasm is a WebAssembly engine implemented in GraalVM. It can interpret and compile WebAssembly programs in the binary format, or be embedded into other programs.

- **[Wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3):** CLI, Python, Rust, C, C++, Go, Zig, Perl, Swift, .NET, Nim, Arduino, PlatformIO, Particle, QuickJS \
