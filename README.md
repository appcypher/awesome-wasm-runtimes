> A WebAssembly runtime is a software environment that executes programs compiled to the WebAssembly (Wasm) binary format, enabling efficient and portable execution of code. Notable runtimes include V8, SpiderMonkey, and Wasmtime.

- **[V8](https://v8.dev/):** Browser \
    V8 includes its own custom WebAssembly engine.

- **[SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/):** Browser \
    SpiderMonkey is also a WebAssembly engine.

- **[JavaScriptCore](https://docs.webkit.org/Deep%20Dive/JSC/JavaScriptCore.html):** Browser \
    JavaScriptCore includes its own custom WebAssembly engine.

- **[aWsm](https://github.com/gwsystems/aWsm):** CLI \
    WebAssembly ahead-of-time compiler and runtime. Focuses on generating fast code, simplicity, and portability.

- **[Extism](https://extism.org/):** CLI, Rust, JavaScript, Elixr, Go, Haskell, Java, .NET, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Zig, C, C++ \
    The framework for building with WebAssembly (wasm). Easily load wasm modules, move data, call functions, and build extensible apps.

- **[GraalWasm](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/wasm):** Java \
    GraalWasm is a WebAssembly engine implemented in GraalVM. It can interpret and compile WebAssembly programs in the binary format, or be embedded into other programs.

- **[Wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3):** CLI, Python, Rust, C, C++, Go, Zig, Perl, Swift, .NET, Nim, Arduino, PlatformIO, Particle, QuickJS \
    🚀 A fast WebAssembly interpreter and the most universal WASM runtime

- **[WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/):** CLI, C, Rust, Go, Java, C++, Python \
    Bring the cloud-native and serverless application paradigms to Edge Computing.

- **[Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer):** CLI, Rust, C, C++, C#, D, Python, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Ruby, Java, R, Postgres, Swift, Zig, Dart, Crystal, List, Julia, V, OCaml \
    Wasmer is a blazing fast and secure WebAssembly runtime that enables incredibly lightweight containers to run anywhere: from Desktop to the Cloud, Edge and even the browser.

- **[Wasmi](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi):** CLI \
    Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter for embedded systems.

- **[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime):** CLI, Rust, C, C++, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby, Elixr, Perl \
    A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly

- **[WasmVM](https://github.com/WasmVM/WasmVM):** CLI, C++ \
    A standalone WebAssembly process virtual machine

- **[WebAssembly Micro Runtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime):** CLI, C, C++ \
    WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime with small footprint, high performance and highly configurable features for applications cross from embedded, IoT, edge to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), smart contract, cloud native and so on.

- **[wazero](https://wazero.io/):** CLI, Go \
    wazero is the only zero dependency WebAssembly runtime written in Go.

- **[Lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic):** CLI, Rust, AssemblyScript \
    Lunatic is an Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly
